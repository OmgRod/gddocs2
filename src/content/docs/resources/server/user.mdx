## Users

Each player of Geometry Dash has their own profile which includes various different elements such as in-game stats, icons and even socials.

A typical user server response is structured with a `key:value:key:value` pairing and is then split with a `|`

#### **User Example Response**

Each `key` is tied to a component within the client and the `value` sets data for the specific component.  
A list of all known keys can be found in the table below

### Trivia

- Setting Key `29` to `0` stops most aspects of your profile from loading

- Key `27` is impossible to recieve from the server as there is no way for the server to know what the player's `streak` is
