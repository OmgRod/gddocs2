title: 'Client Level Start String'
template: doc
---

The start level string consists of information about the starting state of the level and the objects it contains. It is encoded in [base64](). Its raw representation is formatted as follows:

`{level_start};{object_string}`, where

- `level_start` is the level start object,
- `object_string` is the [object string]().

Theoretically, the start level string in its entirety is the object string, however the level start object is treated specially, unlike every other object, and doesn't even have an ID.

## Level Start Object
The level start object has the following properties, formatted as `{key},{value},{key},{value}`

| Key  | Name                   | Type                                        | Description                                                                                                    |

***Pre-2.0 Keys***

The following keys were valid prior to 2.0 and are deprecated, since they are included in the new `kS38` key. They all represented a color channel that is now indexed through the respective color channel ID.

| Key  | Name         | Color Channel ID |
|:-----|:-------------|:-----------------|
| kS29 | BG Color     | 1000             |
| kS30 | Ground Color | 1001             |
| kS31 | Line Color   | 1002             |
| kS32 | Object Color | 1004             |
| kS33 | Color 1      | 1                |
| kS34 | Color 2      | 2                |
| kS35 | Color 3      | 3                |
| kS36 | Color 4      | 4                |
| kS37 | 3DL Color    | 1003             |

***Pre-1.9 Keys***

The following keys were valid prior to 1.9 and were deprecated as of 1.9, since they were included in the keys `kS29`-`kS33`. Each color, instead of using one key, used 3 keys to represent Red, Green, and Blue values, respectively. In 1.7 and 1.8, the game used a fourth key to determine if a color channel used a player color, and which player color it would use.

| Key(s)    | Name                | Key in 1.9 |
|:----------|:--------------------|:-----------|
| kS1-kS3   | BG Color            | kS29       |
| kS4-kS6   | Ground Color        | kS30       |
| kS7-kS9   | Line Color          | kS31       |
| kS10-kS12 | Object Color        | kS32       |
| kS13-kS15 | Obj-2 Color         | kS33       |
| kS16      | BG Player Color     | kS29       |
| kS17      | Ground Player Color | kS30       |
| kS18      | Line Player Color   | kS31       |
| kS19      | Object Player Color | kS32       |
| kS20      | Obj-2 Player Color  | kS33       |

Keys `kS16`-`kS20` used to determine the player color that was being used and their values were interpreted according to the following table:

| Value | Color          |
|:------|:---------------|
| 0     | Neither        |
| 1     | Player Color 1 |
| 2     | Player Color 2 |

### Start Pos Object
The Start Pos object has the same special properties the level start object has, with a few not working and with a few exclusive ones, listed at the bottom. `kA9` must be set to `1` in the case that the object is indeed a Start Pos.

Specifically, the only functional properties in a Start Pos object are the ones involving gameplay state, thus excluding visual-related ones (BG/ground textures, font, colors, etc.)

Confirmed properties that do not work in the Start Pos:

Since 2.2, the Start Pos object has its own unique properties that do not work in the Level Start object. This is a table of all of them:
