title: 'SFX Library format'
template: doc

The SFX Library is stored in your save directory as `sfxlibrary.dat`. To learn how to retreive it from the servers, refer to [this page](/endpoints/songs/sfxlibrary).

To decode sfxlibrary.dat, you need to [Base64](/topics/encryption/base64) URL-Safe decode it and [Zlib](/topics/encryption/zip) inflate it.

The SFX library is split into 2 parts:

```
{files}|{credits}
```

## Files & folders

`{files}` is a list of files and folders, separated with semicolons. The file format is as follows:

`{id},{name},{isFolder},{parentFolder},{filesize},{duration}`

| Key          | Type      | Description                                                      |
| :----------- | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | `integer` | The sound effect/folder ID                                       |
| name         | `string`  | The sound effect/folder name                                     |
| isFolder     | `boolean` | Whether this is a sound effect or folder                         |
| parentFolder | `integer` | The parent folder                                                |
| filesize     | `integer` | The sound effect file size in bytes                              |
| duration     | `integer` | The duration of the sound effect, in `seconds * 100`             |
 
The first "folder" is a special case: it has an ID of 1 and its name corresponds to the SFX library version.

## Credits

The `{credits}` part is very simple. It's a list of all the companies/people from which RobTop has licensed the sound effects, in this format:

`{name},{link};{name},{link}...`

where `name` is the name of the company and `link` is a link to their website.
