## Leaderboard Score

Leaderboards are the in-game ranking system for Geometry Dash. There are `7` types of leaderboards that are used as of version `2.11` 
> - `Star Top 100` - The top 100 best star grinders
> - `Star Friends` - The relative leaderboards between the user and his friends
> - `Relative Star` - The players position on the global leaderboards along with 100 other players that have a rank relative to the player
> - `Creator Top 100` - The top 100 creator point grinders
> - `Global Level Scores` - The fastest victors to a specific level since the level was uploaded to the servers
> - `Global Weekly Level Scores` - The fastest victors to a specific level since the last `604800` seconds
> - `Friend Level Scores` - The fastest victors to a specific level between the user and his friends since the level was uploaded to the servers

A typical leaderboard server response is structured with a `key:value:key:value` pairing and is then split with a `|`

### **Level Leaderboard Example**

### **Top Leaderboard Example**

```md
1:Smiffy777:2:7708568:13:164:17:57051:6:1:9:115:10:29:11:14:14:0:15:2:16:1413859:3:273000:52:4684:8:0:46:204136:4:7018    
```

Each `key` is tied to a component within the client and the `value` sets data for the specific component.  
A list of all known keys can be found in the table below

### Level Leaderboard Score Structure

| 16  | accountID				  | **Integer**									 | The user's account ID. **This is different than the player ID**

### Trivia

- The key structure that leaderboards follow are exactly the same as the structure used for [Player Profiles](/resources/server/user.md)
