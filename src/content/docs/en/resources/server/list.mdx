## List Object
A level list is a list of levels - playable objects in Geometry Dash.

A typical list server response is structured with a `key:value:key:value` pairing and is then split with a `|`

Each `key` is tied to a component within the client and the `value` sets data for the specific component.
A list of all known keys can be found in the table below
